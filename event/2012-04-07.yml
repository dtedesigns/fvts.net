  title: Do Some People Really Believe a Dead Man Came Back to Life?
  subtitle: "Join us for an Easter discussion: How have different traditions understood the story of the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth?"
  description: >
    Christians have been celebrating Good Friday and Easter for nearly
    2,000 years.  But why?  That Jesus of Nazareth was executed is a
    given, but what does the Easter holiday celebrate?  Was Jesus really
    raised from the dead?  Was that even the message first Christians
    sought to spread?  Or did they know, even then, that this was a
    metaphorical tale?  How has the story been understood since those
    first days of the Christian movement?  Join us as we consider how
    different traditions have historically understood the story of the
    resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. All are welcome!

  bio: >
    Nicholas is a resident of Batavia and a PhD candidate at Wheaton College. His dissertation
    addresses first century socio-rhetorical uses of sacred texts for the sake of community formation.
    This upcoming talk and discussion will revolve around only a slightly different topic. At the end
    of the 19th century Friedrich Nietzsche also used religious texts to give shape to the burgeoning
    postmodern world when he proclaimed that “God is dead.” Western thinkers in every discipline
    from political theory to the fine arts have taken up this “death of God” motif throughout the
    20th century. Nicholas has observed, however, in his years of teaching philosophy to high
    school seniors and college freshmen, that what Nietzsche specifically meant has been lost in
    the intervening years. Perhaps it is time to reevaluate Nietzsche’s famous pronouncement in
    the light of more than a century’s worth of retrospect. Join us on February 26th at 10am at the
    Batavia Public Library for a lecture and open discussion and Q&A as we consider what it means
    and whether it is true that “God is dead.”
