  title: Is God Dead?
  description: >
    At the end of the 19th century Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed that “God is dead.”  Throughout the 20th century Western thinkers in every discipline have taken up this “death of God” motif.  What did Nietzsche mean by this, and how has he been understood over the subsequent 100+ years?  Join us as we evaluate Nietzsche’s famous pronouncement in the light of more than a century’s worth of retrospect.  What does it mean and is it true that “God is dead?”
