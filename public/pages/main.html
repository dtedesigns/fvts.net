			<h1>Did Jesus Really Say/Do That?</h1>

			<h2 id="subtitle">Did the gospel writers have access to
				eyewitness testimony?</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">
				Did Jesus’ biographers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John—record actual
				historical events?  Was that even their goal?  Were they capable
				historians?  Or were they motivated more by their own historical
				circumstances decades after Jesus’ life and work?  How can we know?
				Theories abound about how much of “the historical Jesus” is available
				to us today.  Join us as Dr. Williams, internationally renowned linguist
				and scholar, explores whether the gospel writers had access to eyewitness
				testimony and the difference that makes for reading these historically
				important documents.
