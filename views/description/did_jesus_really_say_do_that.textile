<div class="event_description">
Did Jesus’ biographers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John—record actual historical events?  Was that even their goal?  Were they capable historians?  Or were they motivated more by their own historical circumstances decades after Jesus’ life and work?  How can we know?  Theories abound about how much of “the historical Jesus” is available to us today.  Join us as Dr. Williams, internationally renowned linguist and scholar, explores whether the gospel writers had access to eyewitness testimony and the difference that makes for reading these historically important documents.
