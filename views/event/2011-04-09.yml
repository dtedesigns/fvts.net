  title: Did Jesus Really Say/Do That?
  subtitle: Did the gospel writers have access to eyewitness testimony?
  description: >
    Did Jesus’ biographers—Matthew, Mark, Luke and
    John—record actual historical events?  Was that
    even their goal?  Were they capable historians?
    Or were they motivated more by their own historical
    circumstances decades after Jesus’ life and work?
    How can we know?  Theories abound about how much of “the
    historical Jesus” is available to us today.  Join us
    as Dr. Williams, internationally renowned linguist and
    scholar, explores whether the gospel writers had access
    to eyewitness testimony and the difference that makes
    for reading these historically important documents.
