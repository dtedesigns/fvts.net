	'description' : "Twenty-first century American culture is comprised of an innumerable collection of subcultures, all set side by side right next to each other. In a given day we all rub shoulders with any number of these subcultures—each one with a different set of values, ethics, goals, and competing claims on what is true. But who says what is true? Is there any way to tell who has the truth? Does anyone have the truth? Does truth exist? Is truth accessible to us? Join us as we consider “What is truth” in a pluralistic age. All are welcome!",
