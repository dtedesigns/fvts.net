  title: Says Who?
  subtitle: Can we find truth in a pluralistic age?
  description: >
    Twenty-first century American culture is comprised of an innumerable
    collection of subcultures, all set side by side right next to each
    other. In a given day we all rub shoulders with any number of these
    subcultures—each one with a different set of values, ethics,
    goals, and competing claims on what is true. But who says what is
    true? Is there any way to tell who has the truth? Does anyone have
    the truth? Does truth exist? Is truth accessible to us? Join us as
    we consider “What is truth” in a pluralistic age. All are welcome!
