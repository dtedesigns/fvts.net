				<h2>Is Christianity Intellectual Suicide?</h2>
				<table><tr>
					<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/head in sand.jpg" alt="Man with head in sand" /></td>
					<td class="event_description">
					Haven't modernity and the sciences disproved just
					about every Christian doctrine? Why, then, does the
					religion persist? Does it attract the dimwitted and the
					intellectually lazy? Or does it make people so, breeding
					ignorance as it spreads?
					<br />Join us, but do not check your brain at the door,
					as we consider if there is any philosophical warrant for
					Christian belief anymore.</td>

				<h2>How Did Humans Emerge From The Mud?</h2>
				<table>
					<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/emerge_from_the_mud.jpg" alt="How did humans emerge from the mud?" /></td>
					<td class="event_description">
					Did we evolve, or were we created? Whether we are
					just another animal or created in the image of God has
					important personal and societal implications. Do we have
					to choose between science and religion, or is there a way
					to reconcile the two?<br />
					This issue tends to spark heated debate, but our
					conversation we will try to generate light rather than
					heat.

				<h2>Does God Exist?</h2>
				<table>
					<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/Looking_into_the_abyss-small.jpg" alt="Looking into the abyss" /></td>
					<td class="event_description">
					Is there any possible way at all to know whether God exists?  How can
					we even answer such a question?  Is the idea of divine revelation at
					all plausible?  How can we believe anything about God anyway, if there
					have been so many competing ideas of what he/she/it is?  And does this
					question even matter?  Join us as we consider whether “God is dead.”

					Society to campus to present his seminar "Proof" at 8 p.m. in the Regency
					Room of the Holmes Student Center to interested NIU students of all beliefs.

					people's lives today.

				<h2>Is Religion Dangerous?</h2>
				<table><tr>

					<td class="event_description">
					The attacks on New York City and Washington DC
					of September 11, 2001 are but a small sampling of the
					many atrocities committed in the name of religion over
					the centuries.	Wouldn't our world be a much safer place,
					therefore, if the ideologies that resulted in such violence
					did not exist?  Join us as we imagine "no hell below us;
					above us only sky."</td>

				<table><tr>

					<td class="event_description">
					The Fox Valley Theological Society is sponsoring a public lecture and

					as we together think diligently about the philosophical, theological
					and practical implications of the very real presence of suffering and
					evil in our world.

				<h2>Do Some People Really Believe That A Dead Man Came Back To Life?</h2>
				<table><tr>
					<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/empty-tomb-small.jpg" alt="Empty Tomb?" /></td>
					<td class="event_description">
					To believe that a dead man came back to life is a lot to swallow.
					No wonder there have been many competing theories as to what actually
					happened on the first “Easter” morning and what kicked the Christian
					movement off.  Join us as we consider how different traditions have
					historically understood the story of the resurrection of Jesus of
					Nazareth?

				<h2>Is Christianity Arrogant?</h2>
				<table><tr>
					<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/arrogant-small.jpg" alt="Arrogant?" /></td>
					<td class="event_description">
					When comparing religions, it is often said that “All paths lead up
					the same mountain of truth.”  Yet, Christians claim that Jesus is
					the only way to the Father.  How can they make such an exclusive claim?
					How can any one group claim to know the only way to God?   Living in a
					pluralistic society, isn’t such a claim inherently arrogant?

				<h2>Did a Virgin Really Have a Baby?</h2>
				<table><tr>
					<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/baby-jesus-small.jpg" alt="Manager Scene" /></td>
					<td class="event_description">
					The virgin birth of Jesus of Nazareth is at the very root of our Christmas
					traditions. Needless to say many people dismiss such a story as myth.
					Others, however, take it as literal history; God performed a miracle.
					Well, did it happen?  Is this the work of God?  Or is it a story by men?
					How can we know?  How can we find out?  Is it simply a charming tale we
					tell during a brief season in winter to help lift our holiday sentiment?
					Or is there something more lasting, more profound here?
