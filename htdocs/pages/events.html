				<h2>Is Christianity Intellectual Suicide?</h2>

					<td class="event_description">
					Haven't modernity and the sciences disproved just
					about every Christian doctrine? Why, then, does the
					religion persist? Does it attract the dimwitted and the
					intellectually lazy? Or does it make people so, breeding
					ignorance as it spreads?
					<br />Join us, but do not check your brain at the door,
					as we consider if there is any philosophical warrant for
					Christian belief anymore.</td>

					Did we evolve, or were we created? Whether we are
					just another animal or created in the image of God has
					important personal and societal implications. Do we have
					to choose between science and religion, or is there a way
					to reconcile the two?<br />
					This issue tends to spark heated debate, but our
					conversation we will try to generate light rather than
					heat.</p>

					<td class="event_description">
					The attacks on New York City and Washington DC
					of September 11, 2001 are but a small sampling of the
					many atrocities committed in the name of religion over
					the centuries.	Wouldn't our world be a much safer place,
					therefore, if the ideologies that resulted in such violence
					did not exist?

				<h2>Did a Virgin Really Have a Baby?</h2>
				<table><tr>
					<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/baby-jesus-small.jpg" alt="Manager Scene" /></td>
					<td class="event_description">
					The virgin birth of Jesus of Nazareth is at the very root of our Christmas
					traditions.  Needless to say many people wink, even scoff, at such a story
					and dismiss it as myth.  As they argue, virgins just don’t have babies.
					No thinking person can possibly believe it.  The common popular account
					of the origin of the Christmas story, then, is that it is a fictitious
					tale, borrowed in its most fundamental elements from the ubiquitous pagan
					cults that populated the ancient world.  In short, it’s been borrowed
					and baptized into the Christian tradition.  Others, however, take this
					story as literal history.  It really happened; God performed a miracle.
					Well, did it happen?  Is this the work of God?  Or is it a story by men?
					How can we know?  How can we find out?  Where did the story come from if
					it’s not an historical account?  And perhaps most importantly, what
					does it mean if it is a true story?  Is it simply a charming tale we
					tell during a brief season in winter to help lift our holiday sentiment?
					Or is there something more lasting, more profound here?
