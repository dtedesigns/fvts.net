			<h2>Is Christianity Intellectual Suicide?</h2>
			<table><tr>
				<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/head in sand.jpg" alt="Man with head in sand" /></td>
				<td>Haven't modernity and the sciences disproved just
				about every Christian doctrine? Why, then, does the
				religion persist? Does it attract the dimwitted and the
				intellectually lazy? Or does it make people so, breeding
				ignorance as it spreads?
				<br />Join us, but do not check your brain at the door,
				as we consider if there is any philosophical warrant for
				Christian belief anymore.</td>

			<h2>How Did Humans Emerge From The Mud?</h2>
			<table>
				<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/emerge_from_the_mud.jpg" alt="How did humans emerge from the mud?" /></td>
				<td>Did we evolve, or were we created? Whether we are
				just another animal or created in the image of God has
				important personal and societal implications. Do we have
				to choose between science and religion, or is there a way
				to reconcile the two?<br />
				This issue tends to spark heated debate, but our
				conversation we will try to generate light rather than
				heat.</p>

			<h1>Previous Events</h1>

			<h2>Is Religion Dangerous?</h2>
			<table><tr>
				<td><img class="event_pic" src="images/911 lights.jpg" alt="9/11 Lights" /></td>
				<td>The attacks on New York City and Washington DC
				of September 11, 2001 are but a small sampling of the
				many atrocities committed in the name of religion over
				the centuries.	Wouldn't our world be a much safer place,
				therefore, if the ideologies that resulted in such violence
				did not exist?
				<br />Join us as we imagine "no hell below us; above us
				only sky."</td>
