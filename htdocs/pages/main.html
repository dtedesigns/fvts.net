			<p>Dr. Jerry Root (Ph.D., British Open University) <br />Adjunct Professor of Christian Formation & Ministry, Wheaton College (IL) </p>

			<div id="bio">
				<p>Jerry was born and raised in Southern California. He
				grew up in a Christian family but did not become
				a Christian until his freshman year at Whittier
				College. </p><p>He was deeply influenced by the ministries
				of Campus Crusade for Christ and Granada Heights Friends
				Church in La Mirada, California. Jerry's sister Kathy
				introduced him to the writings of C. S. Lewis while he
				was still an undergraduate. Upon graduation from college
				he selected Lewis as an author who would take him to other
				authors and has made of him a life study. The concept that
				graduation from college is "Commencement" has meant that
				only a foundation for learning is established through
				formal education after which one commences his/her
				liberal arts education.</p>
				<p>He pastored three different churches over twenty-three
				years. Nineteen of those years were invested in student ministry,
				and for four years he served as a senior pastor. While pastoring
				he taught courses in Philosophy and on C. S. Lewis for ten years
				at the College of Du Page in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. He has served
				on the Adjunct Faculty at Biola University since 1991, teaching
				courses on Lewis. He has been teaching at Wheaton College since
				1996. Jerry has lectured or preached in 14 different countries
				around the world and has also lectured extensively throughout
				the United States.</p>
