			<!--<h2 id="subtitle">Is Christianity Intellectual Suicide?</h2>-->
			<p style="text-align:justify;">
				Haven't modernity and the sciences disproved just
				about every Christian doctrine? Why, then, does the
				religion persist? Does it attract the dimwitted and the
				intellectually lazy? Or does it make people so, breeding
				ignorance as it spreads?
				<br />Join us, but do not check your brain at the door,
				as we consider if there is any philosophical warrant for
				Christian belief anymore.

			<p style="text-align:justify;">The attacks on New York City and Washington
			DC of September 11, 2001 are but a small sampling of the many atrocities
			committed in the name of religion over the centuries.	Wouldn't our world
			be a much safer place, therefore, if the ideologies that resulted in such
			violence did not exist? Join us as we imagine "no hell below us; above us

			<h2>Our Speaker</h2>
			<img id="speaker" src="images/Nicholas.jpg" />
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">Nicholas Piotrowski</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">
				Nicholas is a resident of Batavia and a PhD candidate at Wheaton College.
				His dissertation addresses first century socio-rhetorical uses of sacred
				texts for the sake of community formation.  This upcoming talk and
				discussion will revolve around only a slightly different topic.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">
				Why do we still have communities that adhere to these same sacred texts
				1900 years later?  Nicholas has noticed that the common answer is that
				religious people—and Christians in particular—are simply bird-brains.
				Whether it’s the sort of people ABC News interviews, the commentators on
				MSNBC, or the characters in popular stories, the lament (and irritation)
				is common: “Christians have been left behind by modernity, science,
				politics, and art,” and need to “leave the cry baby stage [of life]
				and finally come of age.”  Such a pervasive sentiment caused Nicholas
				to think: are all Christians really such dunderheads?  Is becoming a
				Christian tantamount to checking your brain at the proverbial door?
				And is the religion itself to blame?  Does Christianity attract
				the slow, the uneducated, the unreflective, the unenlightened, and
				the intellectually lazy?  Or does it make people so?
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">
				In short, is Christianity intellectual suicide?  Before moving to the
				Fox Valley Nicholas taught, among other things, History and Philosophy
				at the Washington Christian Academy in Olney, Maryland.  There he was
				able to flesh out and develop many of his burgeoning ideas on this topic,
				in the context no less of a rigorous college-prep high school.  On
				October 23rd he’ll briefly share some of his thoughts before opening the
				floor to question and dialogue.
