				Did we evolve, or were we created? Whether we are just another animal
				or created in the image of God has important personal and societal
				implications. Do we have to choose between science and religion, or
				is there a way to reconcile the two?  This issue tends to spark
				heated debate, but our conversation will try to generate light rather
				than heat.

			<p style="text-align:justify;">The attacks on New York City and Washington
			DC of September 11, 2001 are but a small sampling of the many atrocities
			committed in the name of religion over the centuries.	Wouldn't our world
			be a much safer place, therefore, if the ideologies that resulted in such
			violence did not exist? Join us as we imagine "no hell below us; above us
			only sky."</p>

			<h2>Our Speaker</h2>
			<img id="speaker" src="images/RauPic.jpg" />
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
				Gerald Rau (Ph.D. Cornell), Independent Scholar,<br />Chiayi Taiwan
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">
Dr. Rau has spent his career teaching Biology to high school and college
students in both America and Taiwan.  After fifteen years teaching high
school and middle school science at Lincoln American School in Taiwan,
Dr. Rau recently taught Biology at Wheaton College and Trinity Christian
College before returning to Taiwan. His academic passions include the
intersection of science and faith and how the fundamentals of learning
and education come to bear upon this subject.  Dr. Rau is currently
writing a book, to be published by Inter-Varsity Press, which explores
these important topics.  Dr. Rau was educated at Wesleyan University
(B.A. biology), the University of Minnesota (M.A. horticulture), and Cornell
University (Ph.D. plant breeding), and returned to the University of Michigan
a few years ago for an M.A. in science education, concentrating on the
philosophy of science in relation to science teaching.
