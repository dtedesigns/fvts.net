			<h1>Is God Dead?</h1>

			<p style="text-align:justify;">
At the end of the 19th century Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed that
“God is dead.”  Throughout the 20th century Western thinkers in
every discipline have taken up this “death of God” motif.  What did
Nietzsche mean by this, and how has he been understood over the subsequent
100+ years?  Join us as we evaluate Nietzsche’s famous pronouncement
in the light of more than a century’s worth of retrospect.  What does
it mean and is it true that “God is dead?”

			<h2>Our Speaker</h2>
			<img id="speaker" src="images/speaker.jpg" />
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">
				Nicholas Piotrowski
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">
Nicholas is a resident of Batavia and a PhD candidate at Wheaton College.
His dissertation addresses first century socio-rhetorical uses of sacred
texts for the sake of community formation.  This upcoming talk and
discussion will revolve around only a slightly different topic.  At the
end of the 19th century Friedrich Nietzsche also used religious texts
to give shape to the burgeoning postmodern world when he proclaimed that
“God is dead.”  Throughout the 20th century Western thinkers in every
discipline—from political theory to the fine arts—have taken up this
“death of God” motif.  Nicholas has observed, however, in his years of
teaching philosophy to high school seniors and college freshmen, that what
Nietzsche specifically meant has been lost in these intervening years.
Perhaps it is time to reevaluate Nietzsche’s famous pronouncement in
the light of more than a century’s worth of retrospect.  Join us on
February 26th at 10am at the Batavia Public Library for a lecture and
open discussion/Q&amp;A as we consider what it means and whether it is true
that “God is dead.”
