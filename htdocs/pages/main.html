			<h2>Our Speaker</h2>
			<img id="speaker" src="images/Nicholas.jpg" />
			<p>Nicholas Piotrowski</p>
			<p>Nicholas is a resident of Batavia and
				a PhD candidate at Wheaton College.
				His dissertation addresses first century
				socio-rhetorical uses of sacred texts for
				the sake of community formation.  However,
				this upcoming talk and discussion will
				revolve around a very different topic.
			</p>

			<p>In 1996 the American Humanist Society
			awarded Richard Dawkins with the
			“Humanist of the Year Award.”
			He opened his acceptance speech with
			these words: “It is fashionable to wax
			apocalyptic about the threat to humanity
			posed by the AIDS virus, ‘mad cow’
			disease, and many others, but I think a
			case can be made that faith is one of the
			world’s great evils, comparable to the
			smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.”
			Since hearing these words, Nicholas
			has thought deeply about why someone
			would believe this, and whether or not
			it’s a fair statement.  Before moving
			to the Fox Valley Nicholas ministered
			to juvenile offenders in Colorado,
			Mississippi, and then Washington DC.
			The boys he worked with came directly from
			(and participated in the formation of)
			quite violent communities.  During these
			years of ministry he lived directly in the
			matrix of violence and religion.  He also
			taught, among other things, History
			and Ethics at the Washington Christian
			Academy in Olney, Maryland.  There he
			was able to flesh out and develop many
			of his burgeoning ideas on this topic.
			On September 11th he’ll briefly share
			some of his thoughts before opening the
			floor to question and dialogue.
