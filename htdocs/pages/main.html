			<h1>Is Religion Dangerous?</h1>
			<h2 id="subtitle">Would Our World Be a Safer Place Without Religion?</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align:justify;">The attacks on New York City and Washington
			DC of September 11, 2001 are but a small sampling of the many atrocities
			committed in the name of religion over the centuries.	Wouldn't our world
			be a much safer place, therefore, if the ideologies that resulted in such
			violence did not exist? Join us as we imagine "no hell below us; above us
			only sky."</p>

			<h2>Our Speaker</h2>
			<img id="speaker" src="images/Nicholas.jpg" />
			<p style="font-weight:bold;">Nicholas Piotrowski</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Nicholas is a resident of Batavia and
			a PhD candidate at Wheaton College.  His dissertation addresses first
			century socio-rhetorical uses of sacred texts for the sake of community
			formation.  However, this upcoming talk and discussion will revolve
			around a very different topic.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1996
			the American Humanist Society awarded Richard Dawkins with the “Humanist
			of the Year Award.” He opened his acceptance speech with these words:
			“It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity
			posed by the AIDS virus, ‘mad cow’ disease, and many others, but I
			think a case can be made that faith is one of the world’s great evils,
			comparable to the smallpox virus but harder to eradicate.”
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Since hearing
			these words, Nicholas has thought deeply about why someone would believe
			this, and whether or not it’s a fair statement.  Before moving to
			the Fox Valley, Nicholas ministered to juvenile offenders in Colorado,
			Mississippi, and then Washington DC.  The boys he worked with came
			directly from (and participated in the formation of) quite violent
			communities.  During these years of ministry he lived directly in the
			matrix of violence and religion.  He also taught, among other things,
			History and Ethics at the Washington Christian Academy in Olney, Maryland.
			There he was able to flesh out and develop many of his burgeoning ideas
			on this topic.  On September 11th he will briefly share some of his
			thoughts before opening the floor to questions and dialogue.
